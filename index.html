      <ul>
        <li><u>Off-White:</u> Founded in 2012 Virgil Abloh has described Off-White as "the grey area between black and
          white” and
          the brand aims to bridge the gap between streetwear and luxury. The brand is most known for its stylized use
          of
          quotation marks and bold arrows graphic, while showing off Abloh’s Dada design influence.</li>
        <li><u>Comme des Garçons:</u> Japanese fashion label COMME des GARÇONS was founded by Rei Kawakubo and has a
          unique style
          that is all their own. Delving into the realm of sneaker collaborations, each shoe is distinct and vibrant.
        </li>
        <li><u>Supreme:</u> Founded in 1994 by James Jebbia, Supreme is considered the most influential voice in
          streetwear. The
          New York skate brand is known for elevating subcultures through collaborative and subversive methods, working
          with everyone from Nike and COMME des GARCONS to Larry Clark and Jeff Koons.</li>
        <li><u>Palace:</u> Founded in 2009 by Lev Tanju, Palace is recognized as the UK’s answer to Supreme. Known for
          nonsensical
          product descriptions and provocative logo flips, the London label has collaborated with prestigious European
          sporting institutions including English tennis tournament Wimbledon and Italian soccer club Juventus F.C.,
          redefining what a skate brand is capable of.</li>
        <li><u>Acne Studios:</u> Acne Studios dedicates an entire collection to its face motif for FW20. Across apparel
          and
          sneakers, the offerings experiment with playful interpretations of the label’s recurring design. The power of

      <h2><u>Comparison of some shoes:</u></h2>
      <h3>The Air Jordan 1 Mid ‘Chicago Black Toe’</h3>
      <img src="resources/images/jordan.jpg" alt="These are the OG Jordan 1's.">
      <p>The Air Jordan 1 Mid ‘Chicago Black Toe’ draws inspiration from the sneaker’s 1985 roots. The distinctive color
        blocking is reminiscent of the OG ‘Chicago’ colorway, applied to a mid-top silhouette and revised with a black
        finish on the perforated toe box. Jumpman branding adorns the woven tag stitched onto the padded white nylon
        tongue, while a classic Jordan Wings logo is stamped in black on the lateral collar flap.</p>

      <h3>Off-White x Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG 'Chicago'</h3>
      <img src="resources/images/ojordan.jpg" alt="These are the Off-White x Air Jordan 1's.">

        the sneakers' half-finished features include a Swoosh connected to the shoe with visible blue stitching, 'Air'
        printed on the midsole, and an Off-White zip tie on the collar. The box comes deconstructed as it's been turned
        inside-out with the inside consisting of a black base and gold Jumpman logo, while the outside is plain
        cardboard with the words 'Jumpman' printed on it. Virgil's Off-White collection included remixed iterations of
